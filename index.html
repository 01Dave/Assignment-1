            <p>
                My name is David Adebayo Atanda. Born on the 30th of October, 2001 in Lagos State and I hail from Osun State. I am currently a penultimate student of the University of Lagos, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Statistics. I am also a student of Altschool Africa, a member of the School of Engineering, Backend Engineering track.

            <p>
                My hobbies include reading, watching movies, gaming, coding and researching. I am scientifically driven and I have a passion for discovering how the world works.

                    Why I Joined Altschool Africa

            <p>
                Over the years, I have had quite a significant interest in Computer Programming. Watching movies such as The Matrix, Ex-Machina, The Terminator, Inception and the likes had quite an effect on my young mind and I always wanted to be "The guy in the chair". This led to my interest in the sciences, especially programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I eventually got into senior secondary school, there were no doubts as to my career choice, I was going to be a programmer. I followed this decision dilligently, leading up eventually to my diploma in Computer Science at Yaba College of Technology, and my degree program in Statistics at the University of Lagos.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I realised that as much as I enjoyed studying these courses, I wanted more. I needed a more 'hands-on' approach to my chosen field. I wanted to write code and see my code work. Hence, I started teaching myself, using materials I found on the Internet, including Youtube videos. But I was swamped. There was just so much to learn and cover. I needed a guide and a step by step process to becoming the programmer I desired to be. This search for a guide led to my discovery of Altschool Africa.

            <p>
                My Dad, who has always supported me in my career choice, saw a video of Mr Adewale Yusuf, the CEO of Altschool Africa, being interviewed by Tayo Aina. He made me watch this video and I saw Mr Yusuf talking about wanting to build an 'unconventional university', that caters to the needs of tech driven people who want to further their careers in the tech space. I realised that this was what I had been searching for all this while, a guide that could help me achieve my career goal. Immediately the video ended, I looked up Altschool Africa and made steps toward enrolling in their diploma program, and now, here we are.

                Enrolling in Altschool Africa has been a big step towards achieving my career in tech. I have been taught using a model detailing everything I need to know in order to become a world-class engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Altschool Africa, I hope to become a well grounded developer, a programmer well recognized and acknowledged among my peers in the tech space.
